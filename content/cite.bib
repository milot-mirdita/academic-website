Translating these into discoveries requires aligning them, which is computationally prohibitive. Foldseek-Multimer computes complex alignments from compatible chain-to-chain alignments, identified by efficiently clustering their superposition vectors. Foldseek-Multimer is 3–4 orders of magnitudes faster than the gold standard, while producing comparable alignments; this allows it to compare billions of complex pairs in 11 h. Foldseek-Multimer is open-source software available at GitHub via https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek/, https://search.foldseek.com/search/ and the BFMD database.},

	abstract = {Proteins are key to all cellular processes and their structure is important in understanding their function and evolution. Sequence-based predictions of protein structures have increased in accuracy, and over 214 million predicted structures are available in the AlphaFold database. However, studying protein structures at this scale requires highly efficient methods. Here, we developed a structural-alignment-based clustering algorithm—Foldseek cluster—that can cluster hundreds of millions of structures. Using this method, we have clustered all of the structures in the AlphaFold database, identifying 2.30 million non-singleton structural clusters, of which 31\% lack annotations representing probable previously undescribed structures. Clusters without annotation tend to have few representatives covering only 4\% of all proteins in the AlphaFold database. Evolutionary analysis suggests that most clusters are ancient in origin but 4\% seem to be species specific, representing lower-quality predictions or examples of de novo gene birth. We also show how structural comparisons can be used to predict domain families and their relationships, identifying examples of remote structural similarity. On the basis of these analyses, we identify several examples of human immune-related proteins with putative remote homology in prokaryotic species, illustrating the value of this resource for studying protein function and evolution across the tree of life.},

	abstract = {Background
Protein annotation is a major goal in molecular biology, yet experimentally determined knowledge is typically limited to a few model organisms. In non-model species, the sequence-based prediction of gene orthology can be used to infer protein identity; however, this approach loses predictive power at longer evolutionary distances. Here we propose a workflow for protein annotation using structural similarity, exploiting the fact that similar protein structures often reflect homology and are more conserved than protein sequences.
            
Results
We propose a workflow of openly available tools for the functional annotation of proteins via structural similarity (MorF: MorphologFinder) and use it to annotate the complete proteome of a sponge. Sponges are highly relevant for inferring the early history of animals, yet their proteomes remain sparsely annotated. MorF accurately predicts the functions of proteins with known homology in {\textgreater}90\% cases and annotates an additional 50\% of the proteome beyond standard sequence-based methods. We uncover new functions for sponge cell types, including extensive FGF, TGF, and Ephrin signaling in sponge epithelia, and redox metabolism and control in myopeptidocytes. Notably, we also annotate genes specific to the enigmatic sponge mesocytes, proposing they function to digest cell walls.
              
Conclusions
Our work demonstrates that structural similarity is a powerful approach that complements and extends sequence similarity searches to identify homologous proteins over long evolutionary distances. We anticipate this will be a powerful approach that boosts discovery in numerous -omics datasets, especially for non-model organisms.},

	abstract = {Adapting language models to protein sequences spawned the development of powerful protein language models (pLMs). Concurrently, AlphaFold2 broke through in protein structure prediction. Now we can systematically and comprehensively explore the dual nature of proteins that act and exist as three-dimensional (3D) machines and evolve as linear strings of one-dimensional (1D) sequences. Here, we leverage pLMs to simultaneously model both modalities in a single model. We encode protein structures as token sequences using the 3Di-alphabet introduced by the 3D-alignment method Foldseek. For training, we built a non-redundant dataset from AlphaFoldDB and fine-tuned an existing pLM (ProtT5) to translate between 3Di and amino acid sequences. As a proof-of-concept for our novel approach, dubbed Protein ‘structure-sequence’ T5 (ProstT5), we showed improved performance for subsequent, structure-related prediction tasks, leading to three orders of magnitude speedup for deriving 3Di. This will be crucial for future applications trying to search metagenomic sequence databases at the sensitivity of structure comparisons. Our work showcased the potential of pLMs to tap into the information-rich protein structure revolution fueled by AlphaFold2. ProstT5 paves the way to develop new tools integrating the vast resource of 3D predictions and opens new research avenues in the post-AlphaFold2 era.},

Results
We developed a single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) vectorized implementation of the Viterbi algorithm for profile HMM alignment and introduced various other speed-ups. These accelerated the search methods HHsearch by a factor 4 and HHblits by a factor 2 over the previous version 2.0.16. HHblits3 is ∼10× faster than PSI-BLAST and ∼20× faster than HMMER3. Jobs to perform HHsearch and HHblits searches with many query profile HMMs can be parallelized over cores and over cluster servers using OpenMP and message passing interface (MPI). The free, open-source, GPLv3-licensed software is available at https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite.
Conclusion
The added functionalities and increased speed of HHsearch and HHblits should facilitate their use in large-scale protein structure and function prediction, e.g. in metagenomics and genomics projects.},

Uniclust90 and Uniclust50 clusters showed better consistency of functional annotation than those of UniRef90 and UniRef50, owing to an optimised clustering pipeline that runs with our MMseqs2 software for fast and sensitive protein sequence searching and clustering.

	abstract = {Metagenomics is revolutionizing the study of microorganisms and their involvement in biological, biomedical, and geochemical processes, allowing us to investigate by direct sequencing a tremendous diversity of organisms without the need for prior cultivation. Unicellular eukaryotes play essential roles in most microbial communities as chief predators, decomposers, phototrophs, bacterial hosts, symbionts, and parasites to plants and animals. Investigating their roles is therefore of great interest to ecology, biotechnology, human health, and evolution. However, the generally lower sequencing coverage, their more complex gene and genome architectures, and a lack of eukaryote-specific experimental and computational procedures have kept them on the sidelines of metagenomics.
Results
MetaEuk is a toolkit for high-throughput, reference-based discovery, and annotation of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic metagenomic contigs. It performs fast searches with 6-frame-translated fragments covering all possible exons and optimally combines matches into multi-exon proteins. We used a benchmark of seven diverse, annotated genomes to show that MetaEuk is highly sensitive even under conditions of low sequence similarity to the reference database. To demonstrate MetaEuk’s power to discover novel eukaryotic proteins in large-scale metagenomic data, we assembled contigs from 912 samples of the Tara Oceans project. MetaEuk predicted {\textgreater}12,000,000 protein-coding genes in 8 days on ten 16-core servers. Most of the discovered proteins are highly diverged from known proteins and originate from very sparsely sampled eukaryotic supergroups.
Conclusion
The open-source (GPLv3) MetaEuk software (https://github.com/soedinglab/metaeuk) enables large-scale eukaryotic metagenomics through reference-based, sensitive taxonomic and functional annotation.},

DescribePROT delivers a comprehensive collection of 13 complementary descriptors predicted using 10 popular and accurate algorithms for 83 complete proteomes that cover key model organisms. The current version includes 7.8 billion predictions for close to 600 million amino acids in 1.4 million proteins. The descriptors encompass sequence conservation, position specific scoring matrix, secondary structure, solvent accessibility, intrinsic disorder, disordered linkers, signal peptides, MoRFs and interactions with proteins, DNA and RNAs. Users can search DescribePROT by the amino acid sequence and the UniProt accession number and entry name. The pre-computed results are made available instantaneously. The predictions can be accesses via an interactive graphical interface that allows simultaneous analysis of multiple descriptors and can be also downloaded in structured formats at the protein, proteome and whole database scale. The putative annotations included by DescriPROT are useful for a broad range of studies, including: investigations of protein function, applied projects focusing on therapeutics and diseases, and in the development of predictors for other protein sequence descriptors. Future releases will expand the coverage of DescribePROT. DescribePROT can be accessed at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/DESCRIBEPROT/.},

Specifically, the project was set to analyse and exploit viral metagenomes with the ultimate goal of developing new gene products with high innovation value for applications in biotechnology, pharmaceutical, medical, and the life science sectors. Viral gene pool analysis is also essential to obtain fundamental insight into ecosystem dynamics and to investigate how viruses influence the evolution of microbes and multicellular organisms. The Virus-X Consortium, established in 2016, included experts from eight European countries. The unique approach based on high throughput bioinformatics technologies combined with structural and functional studies resulted in the development of a biodiscovery pipeline of significant capacity and scale. The activities within the Virus-X consortium cover the entire range from bioprospecting and methods development in bioinformatics to protein production and characterisation, with the final goal of translating our results into new products for the bioeconomy. The significant impact the consortium made in all of these areas was possible due to the successful cooperation between expert teams that worked together to solve a complex scientific problem using state-of-the-art technologies as well as developing novel tools to explore the virosphere, widely considered as the last great frontier of life.},

PredictProtein's infrastructure has moved to the LCSB increasing throughput; the use of MMseqs2 sequence search reduced runtime five-fold (apparently without lowering performance of prediction methods); user interface elements improved usability, and new prediction methods were added. PredictProtein recently included predictions from deep learning embeddings (GO and secondary structure) and a method for the prediction of proteins and residues binding DNA, RNA, or other proteins. PredictProtein.org aspires to provide reliable predictions to computational and experimental biologists alike.

By using SRA data, we achieved highly accurate predictions (GDT\_TS {\textgreater} 70) for 66\% of the non-easy targets, whereas using ColabFold-search default MSAs scored highly in only 52\%. Next, we tested the effect of deep homology search and ColabFold's advanced features, such as more recycles, on prediction accuracy. While SRA homologs were most significant for improving ColabFold's CASP15 ranking from 11th to 3rd place, other strategies contributed too.

We first document the composition of the dataset and describe the quality filtering steps taken to remove poor quality data. We make the OMG corpus available as a mixed-modality genomic sequence dataset that represents multi-gene encoding genomic sequences with translated amino acids for protein coding sequences, and nucleic acids for intergenic sequences. We train the first mixed-modality genomic language model (gLM2) that leverages genomic context information to learn robust functional representations, as well as coevolutionary signals in protein-protein interfaces and genomic regulatory syntax. Furthermore, we show that deduplication in embedding space can be used to balance the corpus, demonstrating improved performance on downstream tasks.

To find homologous protein matches, Spacedust uses fast and sensitive structure comparison with Foldseek. Partially conserved clusters are detected using novel clustering and order conservation P-values. We demonstrate Spacedust’s sensitivity with an all-versus-all analysis of 1,308 bacterial genomes, identifying 72,843 conserved gene clusters containing 58\% of the 4.2 million genes. It recovered 95\% of antiviral defense system clusters annotated by the specialized tool PADLOC.

	abstract = {Since its public release in 2021, AlphaFold2 (AF2) has made investigating biological questions, by using predicted protein structures of single monomers or full complexes, a common practice. ColabFold-AF2 is an open-source Jupyter Notebook inside Google Colaboratory and a command-line tool that makes it easy to use AF2 while exposing its advanced options. ColabFold-AF2 shortens turnaround times of experiments because of its optimized usage of AF2’s models. In this protocol, we guide the reader through ColabFold best practices by using three scenarios: (i) monomer prediction, (ii) complex prediction and (iii) conformation sampling. The first two scenarios cover classic static structure prediction and are demonstrated on the human glycosylphosphatidylinositol transamidase protein. The third scenario demonstrates an alternative use case of the AF2 models by predicting two conformations of the human alanine serine transporter 2. Users can run the protocol without computational expertise via Google Colaboratory or in a command-line environment for advanced users. Using Google Colaboratory, it takes {\textless}2 h to run each procedure. The data and code for this protocol are available at https://protocol.colabfold.com.},

	abstract = {The annotation of deeply sequenced, de novo assembled transcriptomes continues to be a challenge as some of the state-of-the-art tools are slow, difficult to install, and hard to use. We have tackled these issues with TransAnnot, a fast, automated transcriptome annotation pipeline that is easy to install and use. Leveraging the fast sequence searches provided by the MMseqs2 suite, TransAnnot offers one-step annotation of homologs from Swiss-Prot, gene ontology terms and orthogroups from eggNOG, and functional domains from Pfam. Users also have the option to annotate against custom databases. TransAnnot accepts sequencing reads (short and long), nucleotide sequences, or amino acid sequences as input for annotation. When benchmarked with test data sets of amino acid sequences, TransAnnot was 333, 284, and 18 times faster than comparable tools such as EnTAP, Trinotate, and eggNOG-mapper respectively.

	abstract = {The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB) is the largest repository of accurately predicted structures with taxonomic labels. Despite providing predictions for over 214 million UniProt entries, the AFDB does not cover viral sequences, severely limiting their study. To address this, we created the Big Fantastic Virus Database (BFVD), a repository of 351 242 protein structures predicted by applying ColabFold to the viral sequence representatives of the UniRef30 clusters. By utilizing homology searches across two petabases of assembled sequencing data, we improved 36\% of these structure predictions beyond ColabFold’s initial results. BFVD holds a unique repertoire of protein structures as over 62\% of its entries show no or low structural similarity to existing repositories. We demonstrate how a substantial fraction of bacteriophage proteins, which remained unannotated based on their sequences, can be matched with similar structures from BFVD. In that, BFVD is on par with the AFDB, while holding nearly three orders of magnitude fewer structures. BFVD is an important virus-specific expansion to protein structure repositories, offering new opportunities to advance viral research. BFVD can be freely downloaded at bfvd.steineggerlab.workers.dev and queried using Foldseek and UniProt labels at bfvd.foldseek.com.},

	doi = {10.1101/2025.04.23.650224v1},
	abstract = {Protein structure prediction breakthroughs, notably AlphaFold2 and ESMfold, have led to an unprecedented influx of computationally derived structures. The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database now provides over 200 million models, while the ESM Metagenomic Atlas includes more than 600 million predictions from uncultured microbes. Here, we combine these two resources into the AFESM, an 821-million-entry dataset, and cluster them using a two-step pipeline based on sequence and structure similarity, yielding 5.12 million non-singleton structural clusters. We identify common ancestors and biomes for these clusters to explore their environmental diversity and specificity, and we investigate their domain composition for structural novelties. Initial ESMfold-based predictions revealed no novel domain folds, re-predicting 2.3 million proteins with AlphaFold2 yielded only one new fold, suggesting near-saturation of the domain space and limitations of predictors. Nevertheless, we discovered many previously unseen domain combinations, highlighting how ESMatlas expands coverage of the known protein fold space. In particular, we find 11,941 multi-domain architectures not observed before, underscoring the importance of metagenomic data for illuminating underexplored regions of the protein structural universe.

	title = {Scaling down protein language modeling with {MSA} {Pairformer}},
	doi = {10.1101/2025.08.02.668173v1},
	abstract = {Recent efforts in protein language modeling have focused on scaling single-sequence models and their training data, requiring vast compute resources that limit accessibility. Although models that use multiple sequence alignments (MSA), such as MSA Transformer, offer parameter-efficient alternatives by extracting evolutionary information directly from homologous sequences rather than storing it in parameters, they generally underperform compared to single-sequence-based language due to memory inefficiencies that limit the number of sequences and averaging evolutionary signals across the MSA. We address these challenges with MSA Pairformer, a 111M parameter memory-efficient MSA-based protein language model that extracts evolutionary signals most relevant to a query sequence through bi-directional updates of sequence and pairwise representations. MSA Pairformer achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised contact prediction, outperforming ESM2-15B by 6\% points while using two orders of magnitude fewer parameters. In predicting contacts at protein-protein interfaces, MSA Pair-former substantially outperforms all methods with a 24\% point increase over MSA Transformer. Unlike single-sequence models that deteriorate in variant effect prediction as they scale, MSA Pairformer maintains strong performance in both tasks. Ablation studies reveal triangle operations remove indirect correlations, and unlike MSA Transformer, MSA Pairformer does not hallucinate contacts after removing covariance, enabling reliable screening of interacting sequence pairs. Overall, our work presents an alternative to the current scaling paradigm in protein language modeling, enabling efficient adaptation to rapidly expanding sequence databases and opening new directions for biological discovery.},

Benchmarking reveals that Phold outperforms existing sequence-based homology approaches in functional annotation sensitivity whilst maintaining speed, consistency and scalability. Applying Phold to diverse cultured and metagenomic phage genomes shows it consistently annotates over 50\% of genes on an average phage and 40\% on an average archaeal virus. Comparisons of phage protein structures to other protein structures across the tree of life reveals that phage proteins commonly have structural homology to proteins shared across the tree of life, particularly those that have nucleic acid metabolism and enzymatic functions.
