abstract: 'Background Protein annotation is a major goal in molecular biology, yet
  experimentally determined knowledge is typically limited to a few model organisms.
  In non-model species, the sequence-based prediction of gene orthology can be used
  to infer protein identity; however, this approach loses predictive power at longer
  evolutionary distances. Here we propose a workflow for protein annotation using
  structural similarity, exploiting the fact that similar protein structures often
  reflect homology and are more conserved than protein sequences.  Results We propose
  a workflow of openly available tools for the functional annotation of proteins via
  structural similarity (MorF: MorphologFinder) and use it to annotate the complete
  proteome of a sponge. Sponges are highly relevant for inferring the early history
  of animals, yet their proteomes remain sparsely annotated. MorF accurately predicts
  the functions of proteins with known homology in textgreater90% cases and annotates
  an additional 50% of the proteome beyond standard sequence-based methods. We uncover
  new functions for sponge cell types, including extensive FGF, TGF, and Ephrin signaling
  in sponge epithelia, and redox metabolism and control in myopeptidocytes. Notably,
  we also annotate genes specific to the enigmatic sponge mesocytes, proposing they
  function to digest cell walls.  Conclusions Our work demonstrates that structural
  similarity is a powerful approach that complements and extends sequence similarity
  searches to identify homologous proteins over long evolutionary distances. We anticipate
  this will be a powerful approach that boosts discovery in numerous -omics datasets,
  especially for non-model organisms.'
