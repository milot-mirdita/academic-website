abstract: 'Protein structure is conserved beyond sequence, making multiple structural
  alignment (MSTA) essential for analyzing distantly related proteins. Computational
  prediction methods have vastly extended our repository of available proteins structures,
  requiring fast and accurate MSTA methods. Here, we introduce FoldMason, a progressive
  MSTA method that leverages the structural alphabet from Foldseek, a pairwise structural
  aligner, for multiple alignment of hundreds of thousands of protein structures,
  exceeding alignment quality of state-of-the-art methods, while two orders of magnitudes
  faster than other MSTA methods. FoldMason computes confidence scores, offers interactive
  visualizations, and provides essential speed and accuracy for large-scale protein
  structure analysis in the era of accurate structure prediction. Using Flaviviridae
  glycoproteins, we demonstrate how FoldMasonâ€™s MSTAs support phylogenetic analysis
  below the twilight zone. FoldMason is free open-source software: foldmason.foldseek.com
  and webserver: search.foldseek.com/foldmason.'
