abstract: Every two years groups worldwide participate in the Critical Assessment
  of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment to blindly test the strengths
  and weaknesses of their computational methods. CASP has significantly advanced the
  field but many hurdles still remain, which may require new ideas and collaborations.
  In 2012 a web-based effort called WeFold, was initiated to promote collaboration
  within the CASP community and attract researchers from other fields to contribute
  new ideas to CASP. Members of the WeFold coopetition (cooperation and competition)
  participated in CASP as individual teams, but also shared components of their methods
  to create hybrid pipelines and actively contributed to this effort. We assert that
  the scale and diversity of integrative prediction pipelines could not have been
  achieved by any individual lab or even by any collaboration among a few partners.
  The models contributed by the participating groups and generated by the pipelines
  are publicly available at the WeFold website providing a wealth of data that remains
  to be tapped. Here, we analyze the results of the 2014 and 2016 pipelines showing
  improvements according to the CASP assessment as well as areas that require further
  adjustments and research.
