abstract: 'The MPI Bioinformatics Toolkit (https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de) provides
  interactive access to a wide range of the best‐performing bioinformatics tools and
  databases, including the state‐of‐the‐art protein sequence comparison methods HHblits
  and HHpred. The Toolkit currently includes 35 external and in‐house tools, covering
  functionalities such as sequence similarity searching, prediction of sequence features,
  and sequence classification. Due to this breadth of functionality, the tight interconnection
  of its constituent tools, and its ease of use, the Toolkit has become an important
  resource for biomedical research and for teaching protein sequence analysis to students
  in the life sciences. In this article, we provide detailed information on utilizing
  the three most widely accessed tools within the Toolkit: HHpred for the detection
  of homologs, HHpred in conjunction with MODELLER for structure prediction and homology
  modeling, and CLANS for the visualization of relationships in large sequence datasets.'
