abstract: Highly accurate structure prediction methods are generating an avalanche
  of publicly available protein structures. Searching through these structures is
  becoming the main bottleneck in their analysis. Foldseek enables fast and sensitive
  comparisons of large structure sets. It reaches sensitivities similar to state-of-the-art
  structural aligners while being four to five orders of magnitude faster. Foldseek
  is free open-source software available at foldseek.com and as a webserver at search.foldseek.com.Competing
  Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.
