abstract: SUMMARY Highly accurate protein structure predictors have generated hundreds
  of millions of protein structures; these pose a challenge in terms of storage and
  processing. Here, we present Foldcomp, a novel lossy structure compression algorithm,
  and indexing system to address this challenge. By using a combination of internal
  and Cartesian coordinates and a bi-directional NeRF-based strategy, Foldcomp improves
  the compression ratio by a factor of three compared to the next best method. Its
  reconstruction error of 0.08 Ã… is comparable to the best lossy compressor. It is
  five times faster than the next fastest compressor and competes with the fastest
  decompressors. With its multi-threading implementation and a Python interface that
  allows for easy database downloads and efficient querying of protein structures
  by accession, Foldcomp is a powerful tool for managing and analysing large collections
  of protein structures. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION Foldcomp is a free open-source
  software (GPLv3) and available for Linux, macOS, and Windows at https://foldcomp.foldseek.com.
  Foldcomp provides the AlphaFold Swiss-Prot (2.9GB), TrEMBL (1.1TB), and ESMatlas
  HQ (114GB) database ready-for-download.
