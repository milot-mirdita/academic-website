abstract: As structure prediction methods are generating millions of publicly available
  protein structures, searching these databases is becoming a bottleneck. Foldseek
  aligns the structure of a query protein against a database by describing tertiary
  amino acid interactions within proteins as sequences over a structural alphabet.
  Foldseek decreases computation times by four to five orders of magnitude with 86%,
  88% and 133% of the sensitivities of Dali, TM-align and CE, respectively.
