abstract: The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB) is the largest repository
  of accurately predicted structures with taxonomic labels. Despite providing predictions
  for over 214 million UniProt entries, the AFDB does not cover viral sequences, severely
  limiting their study. To address this, we created the Big Fantastic Virus Database
  (BFVD), a repository of 351 242 protein structures predicted by applying ColabFold
  to the viral sequence representatives of the UniRef30 clusters. By utilizing homology
  searches across two petabases of assembled sequencing data, we improved 36% of these
  structure predictions beyond ColabFold’s initial results. BFVD holds a unique repertoire
  of protein structures as over 62% of its entries show no or low structural similarity
  to existing repositories. We demonstrate how a substantial fraction of bacteriophage
  proteins, which remained unannotated based on their sequences, can be matched with
  similar structures from BFVD. In that, BFVD is on par with the AFDB, while holding
  nearly three orders of magnitude fewer structures. BFVD is an important virus-specific
  expansion to protein structure repositories, offering new opportunities to advance
  viral research. BFVD can be freely downloaded at bfvd.steineggerlab.workers.dev
  and queried using Foldseek and UniProt labels at bfvd.foldseek.com.
