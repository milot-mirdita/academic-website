abstract: Bacteriophage (phage) genome annotation is essential for understanding their
  functional potential and suitability for use as therapeutic agents. Here we introduce
  Phold, an annotation framework utilising protein structural information that combines
  the ProstT5 protein language model and structural alignment tool Foldseek. Phold
  assigns annotations using a database of over 1.36 million predicted phage protein
  structures with high quality functional labels. Benchmarking reveals that Phold
  outperforms existing sequence-based homology approaches in functional annotation
  sensitivity whilst maintaining speed, consistency and scalability. Applying Phold
  to diverse cultured and metagenomic phage genomes shows it consistently annotates
  over 50% of genes on an average phage and 40% on an average archaeal virus. Comparisons
  of phage protein structures to other protein structures across the tree of life
  reveals that phage proteins commonly have structural homology to proteins shared
  across the tree of life, particularly those that have nucleic acid metabolism and
  enzymatic functions. Phold is available as free and open-source software at https://github.com/gbouras13/phold.
