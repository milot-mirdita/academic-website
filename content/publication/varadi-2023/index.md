abstract: The AlphaFold Database Protein Structure Database (AlphaFold DB, https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk)
  has significantly impacted structural biology by amassing over 214 million predicted
  protein structures, expanding from the initial 300k structures released in 2021.
  Enabled by the groundbreaking AlphaFold2 artificial intelligence (AI) system, the
  predictions archived in AlphaFold DB have been integrated into primary data resources
  such as PDB, UniProt, Ensembl, InterPro and MobiDB. Our manuscript details subsequent
  enhancements in data archiving, covering successive releases encompassing model
  organisms, global health proteomes, Swiss-Prot integration, and a host of curated
  protein datasets. We detail the data access mechanisms of AlphaFold DB, from direct
  file access via FTP to advanced queries using Google Cloud Public Datasets and the
  programmatic access endpoints of the database. We also discuss the improvements
  and services added since its initial release, including enhancements to the Predicted
  Aligned Error viewer, customisation options for the 3D viewer, and improvements
  in the search engine of AlphaFold DB.
