 abstract = {Advances in computational structure prediction will vastly augment the hundreds of thousands of currently available protein complex structures. Translating these into discoveries requires aligning them, which is computationally prohibitive. Foldseek-Multimer computes complex alignments from compatible chain-to-chain alignments, identified by efficiently clustering their superposition vectors. Foldseek-Multimer is 3–4 orders of magnitudes faster than the gold standard, while producing comparable alignments; this allows it to compare billions of complex pairs in 11 h. Foldseek-Multimer is open-source software available at GitHub via https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek/, https://search.foldseek.com/search/ and the BFMD database.},
