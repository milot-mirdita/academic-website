abstract: Advances in computational structure prediction will vastly augment the hundreds
  of thousands of currently available protein complex structures. Translating these
  into discoveries requires aligning them, which is computationally prohibitive. Foldseek-Multimer
  computes complex alignments from compatible chain-to-chain alignments, identified
  by efficiently clustering their superposition vectors. Foldseek-Multimer is 3–4
  orders of magnitudes faster than the gold standard, while producing comparable alignments;
  this allows it to compare billions of complex pairs in 11 h. Foldseek-Multimer is
  open-source software available at GitHub via https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek/,
  https://search.foldseek.com/search/ and the BFMD database.
