abstract: The open-source de novo protein-level assembler, Plass (https://plass.mmseqs.com),
  assembles six-frame-translated sequencing reads into protein sequences. It recovers
  2–10 times more protein sequences from complex metagenomes and can assemble huge
  datasets. We assembled two redundancy-filtered reference protein catalogs, 2 billion
  sequences from 640 soil samples (soil reference protein catalog) and 292 million
  sequences from 775 marine eukaryotic metatranscriptomes (marine eukaryotic reference
  catalog), the largest free collections of protein sequences.
