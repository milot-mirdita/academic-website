abstract: We present three clustered protein sequence databases, Uniclust90, Uniclust50,
  Uniclust30 and three databases of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), Uniboost10,
  Uniboost20 and Uniboost30, as a resource for protein sequence analysis, function
  prediction and sequence searches. The Uniclust databases cluster UniProtKB sequences
  at the level of 90%, 50% and 30% pairwise sequence identity. Uniclust90 and Uniclust50
  clusters showed better consistency of functional annotation than those of UniRef90
  and UniRef50, owing to an optimised clustering pipeline that runs with our MMseqs2
  software for fast and sensitive protein sequence searching and clustering. Uniclust
  sequences are annotated with matches to Pfam, SCOP domains, and proteins in the
  PDB, using our HHblits homology detection tool. Due to its high sensitivity, Uniclust
  contains 17% more Pfam domain annotations than UniProt. Uniboost MSAs of three diversities
  are built by enriching the Uniclust30 MSAs with local sequence matches from MMseqs2
  profile searches through Uniclust30. All databases can be downloaded from the Uniclust
  server at uniclust.mmseqs.com. Users can search clusters by keywords and explore
  their MSAs, taxonomic representation, and annotations. Uniclust is updated every
  two months with the new UniProt release.
