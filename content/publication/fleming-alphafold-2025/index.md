abstract: The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)
  has made significant strides in enhancing its utility and accessibility for the
  life science research community. The recent integration of AlphaMissense predictions
  enables access to the pathogenicity of human protein missense variants, with an
  innovative and interactive heatmap and 3D visualisation that display variant data
  at the residue level. Users can now toggle between structure model quality (pLDDT)
  and average pathogenicity scores, providing insights into the implications of specific
  residue changes. The Foldseek integration offers a rapid and accurate method for
  protein structure searches and comparisons. Bulk data download options further facilitate
  comprehensive data analysis and integration with other computational tools. The
  3D-Beacons framework (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-kb/3dbeacons/) has also been
  enhanced with detailed annotation endpoints (such as AlphaMissense data) and integrates
  LevyLab’s dataset of homomeric AlphaFold 2 models. These advancements significantly
  improve the functionality and accessibility of these resources, enabling discoveries
  using structure data.
