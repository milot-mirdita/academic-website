abstract: 'We report the release of PredictProtein for the Debian operating system
  and derivatives, such as Ubuntu, Bio-Linux, and Cloud BioLinux. The PredictProtein
  suite is available as a standard set of open source Debian packages. The release
  covers the most popular prediction methods from the Rost Lab, including methods
  for the prediction of secondary structure and solvent accessibility (profphd), nuclear
  localization signals (predictnls), and intrinsically disordered regions (norsnet).
  We also present two case studies that successfully utilize PredictProtein packages
  for high performance computing in the cloud: the first analyzes protein disorder
  for whole organisms, and the second analyzes the effect of all possible single sequence
  variants in protein coding regions of the human genome.'
