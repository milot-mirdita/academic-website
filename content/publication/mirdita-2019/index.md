abstract: SUMMARY The MMseqs2 desktop and web server app facilitates interactive sequence
  searches through custom protein sequence and profile databases on personal workstations.
  By eliminating MMseqs2's runtime overhead, we reduced response times to a few seconds
  at sensitivities close to BLAST. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION The app is easy
  to install for non-experts. GPLv3-licensed code, pre-built desktop app packages
  for Windows, MacOS and Linux, Docker images for the web server application and a
  demo web server are available at https://search.mmseqs.com. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
