abstract: Detecting similar protein structural motifs, functionally crucial short
  3D patterns, in large structure collections is computationally prohibitive. Therefore,
  we developed Folddisco, which overcomes this through an index of position-independent
  geometric features, including side-chain orientation, combined with a rarity-based
  scoring system. Folddisco indexes 53 million AFDB50 structures into 1.45 terabyte
  within 24 hours, enabling rapid detection of discontinuous or segment motifs. Folddisco
  is more accurate and storage-efficient than state-of-the-art methods, while being
  an order of magnitude faster. Folddisco is free software available at folddisco.foldseek.com
  and a webserver at search.foldseek.com/folddisco.
