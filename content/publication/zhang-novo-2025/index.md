abstract: Metagenomics has revolutionized environmental and human-associated microbiome
  studies. However, the limited fraction of proteins with known biological processes
  and molecular functions presents a major bottleneck. In prokaryotes and viruses,
  evolution favors keeping genes participating in the same biological processes colocalized
  as conserved gene clusters. Conversely, conservation of gene neighborhood indicates
  functional association. Here we present Spacedust, a tool for systematic, de novo
  discovery of conserved gene clusters. To find homologous protein matches, Spacedust
  uses fast and sensitive structure comparison with Foldseek. Partially conserved
  clusters are detected using novel clustering and order conservation P-values. We
  demonstrate Spacedust’s sensitivity with an all-versus-all analysis of 1,308 bacterial
  genomes, identifying 72,843 conserved gene clusters containing 58% of the 4.2 million
  genes. It recovered 95% of antiviral defense system clusters annotated by the specialized
  tool PADLOC. Spacedust’s high sensitivity and speed will facilitate the annotation
  of large numbers of sequenced bacterial, archaeal and viral genomes.
