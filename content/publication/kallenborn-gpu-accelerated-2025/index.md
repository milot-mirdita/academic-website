abstract: Rapidly growing protein databases demand faster sensitive search tools.
  Here the graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated MMseqs2 delivers 6× faster single-protein
  searches than CPU methods on 2 × 64 cores, speeds previously requiring large protein
  batches. For larger query batches, it is the most cost-effective solution, outperforming
  the fastest alternative method by 2.4-fold with eight GPUs. It accelerates protein
  structure prediction with ColabFold 31.8× over the standard AlphaFold2 pipeline
  and protein structure search with Foldseek by 4–27×. MMseqs2-GPU is available under
  an open-source license at https://mmseqs.com/.
