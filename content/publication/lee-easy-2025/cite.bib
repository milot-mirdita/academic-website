 abstract = {Accurate metagenomic taxonomic profiling is critical for understanding microbial communities. However, computational analysis often requires command-line proficiency and high-performance computing resources. To lower these barriers, we developed Metabuli App, an all-in-one desktop application that efficiently runs taxonomic profiling locally on a consumer-grade computer. It features user-friendly graphical interfaces for custom database curation, raw read quality control (QC), taxonomic profiling, and interactive result visualization.
