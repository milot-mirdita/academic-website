abstract: Accurate metagenomic taxonomic profiling is critical for understanding microbial
  communities. However, computational analysis often requires command-line proficiency
  and high-performance computing resources. To lower these barriers, we developed
  Metabuli App, an all-in-one desktop application that efficiently runs taxonomic
  profiling locally on a consumer-grade computer. It features user-friendly graphical
  interfaces for custom database curation, raw read quality control (QC), taxonomic
  profiling, and interactive result visualization.  Availability and implementation  GPLv3-licensed
  source code and prebuilt apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux are available at https://github.com/steineggerlab/Metabuli-App  and
  are archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15876171. Analysis scripts are available
  at https://github.com/jaebeom-kim/metabuli-app-analysis. The Sankey-based taxonomy
  visualization component is available at https://github.com/steineggerlab/taxoview
  for easy integration into other web projects.
