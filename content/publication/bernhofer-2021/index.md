abstract: Since 1992 PredictProtein (https://predictprotein.org) is a one-stop online
  resource for protein sequence analysis with its main site hosted at the Luxembourg
  Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB) and queried monthly by over 3,000 users in
  2020. PredictProtein was the first Internet server for protein predictions. It pioneered
  combining evolutionary information and machine learning. Given a protein sequence
  as input, the server outputs multiple sequence alignments, predictions of protein
  structure in 1D and 2D (secondary structure, solvent accessibility, transmembrane
  segments, disordered regions, protein flexibility, and disulfide bridges) and predictions
  of protein function (functional effects of sequence variation or point mutations,
  Gene Ontology (GO) terms, subcellular localization, and protein-, RNA-, and DNA
  binding). PredictProtein's infrastructure has moved to the LCSB increasing throughput;
  the use of MMseqs2 sequence search reduced runtime five-fold (apparently without
  lowering performance of prediction methods); user interface elements improved usability,
  and new prediction methods were added. PredictProtein recently included predictions
  from deep learning embeddings (GO and secondary structure) and a method for the
  prediction of proteins and residues binding DNA, RNA, or other proteins. PredictProtein.org
  aspires to provide reliable predictions to computational and experimental biologists
  alike. All scripts and methods are freely available for offline execution in high-throughput
  settings.
