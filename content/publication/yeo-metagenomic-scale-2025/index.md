abstract: Protein structure prediction breakthroughs, notably AlphaFold2 and ESMfold,
  have led to an unprecedented influx of computationally derived structures. The AlphaFold
  Protein Structure Database now provides over 200 million models, while the ESM Metagenomic
  Atlas includes more than 600 million predictions from uncultured microbes. Here,
  we combine these two resources into the AFESM, an 821-million-entry dataset, and
  cluster them using a two-step pipeline based on sequence and structure similarity,
  yielding 5.12 million non-singleton structural clusters. We identify common ancestors
  and biomes for these clusters to explore their environmental diversity and specificity,
  and we investigate their domain composition for structural novelties. Initial ESMfold-based
  predictions revealed no novel domain folds, re-predicting 2.3 million proteins with
  AlphaFold2 yielded only one new fold, suggesting near-saturation of the domain space
  and limitations of predictors. Nevertheless, we discovered many previously unseen
  domain combinations, highlighting how ESMatlas expands coverage of the known protein
  fold space. In particular, we find 11,941 multi-domain architectures not observed
  before, underscoring the importance of metagenomic data for illuminating underexplored
  regions of the protein structural universe.  Availability An interactive webserver
  and data are available at afesm.foldseek.com.
