abstract: 'Since its public release in 2021, AlphaFold2 (AF2) has made investigating
  biological questions, by using predicted protein structures of single monomers or
  full complexes, a common practice. ColabFold-AF2 is an open-source Jupyter Notebook
  inside Google Colaboratory and a command-line tool that makes it easy to use AF2
  while exposing its advanced options. ColabFold-AF2 shortens turnaround times of
  experiments because of its optimized usage of AF2â€™s models. In this protocol, we
  guide the reader through ColabFold best practices by using three scenarios: (i)
  monomer prediction, (ii) complex prediction and (iii) conformation sampling. The
  first two scenarios cover classic static structure prediction and are demonstrated
  on the human glycosylphosphatidylinositol transamidase protein. The third scenario
  demonstrates an alternative use case of the AF2 models by predicting two conformations
  of the human alanine serine transporter 2. Users can run the protocol without computational
  expertise via Google Colaboratory or in a command-line environment for advanced
  users. Using Google Colaboratory, it takes textless2 h to run each procedure. The
  data and code for this protocol are available at https://protocol.colabfold.com.'
