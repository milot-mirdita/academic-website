abstract: 'We present DescribePROT, the database of predicted amino acid-level descriptors
  of structure and function of proteins. DescribePROT delivers a comprehensive collection
  of 13 complementary descriptors predicted using 10 popular and accurate algorithms
  for 83 complete proteomes that cover key model organisms. The current version includes
  7.8 billion predictions for close to 600 million amino acids in 1.4 million proteins.
  The descriptors encompass sequence conservation, position specific scoring matrix,
  secondary structure, solvent accessibility, intrinsic disorder, disordered linkers,
  signal peptides, MoRFs and interactions with proteins, DNA and RNAs. Users can search
  DescribePROT by the amino acid sequence and the UniProt accession number and entry
  name. The pre-computed results are made available instantaneously. The predictions
  can be accesses via an interactive graphical interface that allows simultaneous
  analysis of multiple descriptors and can be also downloaded in structured formats
  at the protein, proteome and whole database scale. The putative annotations included
  by DescriPROT are useful for a broad range of studies, including: investigations
  of protein function, applied projects focusing on therapeutics and diseases, and
  in the development of predictors for other protein sequence descriptors. Future
  releases will expand the coverage of DescribePROT. DescribePROT can be accessed
  at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/DESCRIBEPROT/.'
