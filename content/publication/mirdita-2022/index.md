abstract: ColabFold offers accelerated prediction of protein structures and complexes
  by combining the fast homology search of MMseqs2 with AlphaFold2 or RoseTTAFold.
  ColabFold's 40−60-fold faster search and optimized model utilization enables prediction
  of close to 1,000 structures per day on a server with one graphics processing unit.
  Coupled with Google Colaboratory, ColabFold becomes a free and accessible platform
  for protein folding. ColabFold is open-source software available at https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold
  and its novel environmental databases are available at https://colabfold.mmseqs.com.
