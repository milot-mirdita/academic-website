abstract: 'SpacePHARER (CRISPR Spacer Phage–Host Pair Finder) is a sensitive and fast
  tool for de novo prediction of phage–host relationships via identifying phage genomes
  that match CRISPR spacers in genomic or metagenomic data. SpacePHARER gains sensitivity
  by comparing spacers and phages at the protein level, optimizing its scores for
  matching very short sequences, and combining evidence from multiple matches, while
  controlling for false positives. We demonstrate SpacePHARER by searching a comprehensive
  spacer list against all complete phage genomes. Availability and implementation
  SpacePHARER is available as an open-source (GPLv3), user-friendly command-line software
  for Linux and macOS: https://github.com/soedinglab/spacepharer.'
