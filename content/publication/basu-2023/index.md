abstract: The DescribePROT database of amino acid-level descriptors of protein structures
  and functions was substantially expanded since its release in 2020. This expansion
  includes substantial increase in the size, scope, and quality of the underlying
  data, the addition of experimental structural information, the inclusion of new
  data download options, and an upgraded graphical interface. DescribePROT currently
  covers 19 structural and functional descriptors for proteins in 273 reference proteomes
  generated by 11 accurate and complementary predictive tools. Users can search our
  resource in multiple ways, interact with the data using the graphical interface,
  and download data at various scales including individual proteins, entire proteomes,
  and whole database. The annotations in DescribePROT are useful for a broad spectrum
  of studies that include investigations of protein structure and function, development
  and validation of predictive tools, and to support efforts in understanding molecular
  underpinnings of diseases and development of therapeutics. DescribePROT can be freely
  accessed at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/DESCRIBEPROT/.
