 abstract = {Summary: MMseqs2 taxonomy is a new tool to assign taxonomic labels to metagenomic contigs. It extracts all possible protein fragments from each contig, quickly retains those that can contribute to taxonomic annotation, assigns them with robust labels and determines the contig's taxonomic identity by weighted voting. Its fragment extraction step is suitable for the analysis of all domains of life. MMseqs2 taxonomy is 2-18x faster than state-of-the-art tools and also contains new modules for creating and manipulating taxonomic reference databases as well as reporting and visualizing taxonomic assignments.},
