abstract: "Summary: MMseqs2 taxonomy is a new tool to assign taxonomic labels to metagenomic\
  \ contigs. It extracts all possible protein fragments from each contig, quickly\
  \ retains those that can contribute to taxonomic annotation, assigns them with robust\
  \ labels and determines the contig's taxonomic identity by weighted voting. Its\
  \ fragment extraction step is suitable for the analysis of all domains of life.\
  \ MMseqs2 taxonomy is 2-18x faster than state-of-the-art tools and also contains\
  \ new modules for creating and manipulating taxonomic reference databases as well\
  \ as reporting and visualizing taxonomic assignments."
