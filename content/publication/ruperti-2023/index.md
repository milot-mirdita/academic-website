abstract: 'Background Annotating protein function is a major goal in molecular biology,
  yet experimentally determined knowledge is often limited to a few model organisms.
  In non-model species, the sequence-based prediction of gene orthology can be used
  to infer function, however this approach loses predictive power with longer evolutionary
  distances. Here we propose a pipeline for the functional annotation of proteins
  using structural similarity, exploiting the fact that protein structures are directly
  linked to function and can be more conserved than protein sequences.Results We propose
  a pipeline of openly available tools for the functional annotation of proteins via
  structural similarity (MorF: MorphologFinder) and use it to annotate the complete
  proteome of a sponge. Sponges are highly relevant for inferring the early history
  of animals, yet their proteomes remain sparsely annotated. MorF accurately predicts
  the functions of proteins with known homology in &gt;90% cases, and annotates an
  additional 50% of the proteome beyond standard sequence-based methods. Using this,
  we uncover new functions for sponge cell types, including extensive FGF, TGF and
  Ephrin signalling in sponge epithelia, and redox metabolism and control in myopeptidocytes.
  Notably, we also annotate genes specific to the enigmatic sponge mesocytes, proposing
  they function to digest cell walls.Conclusions Our work demonstrates that structural
  similarity is a powerful approach that complements and extends sequence similarity
  searches to identify homologous proteins over long evolutionary distances. We anticipate
  this to be a powerful approach that boosts discovery in numerous -omics datasets,
  especially for non-model organisms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have
  declared no competing interest.'
