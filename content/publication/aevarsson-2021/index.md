abstract: The Virus-X-Viral Metagenomics for Innovation Value-project was a scientific
  expedition to explore and exploit uncharted territory of genetic diversity in extreme
  natural environments such as geothermal hot springs and deep-sea ocean ecosystems.
  Specifically, the project was set to analyse and exploit viral metagenomes with
  the ultimate goal of developing new gene products with high innovation value for
  applications in biotechnology, pharmaceutical, medical, and the life science sectors.
  Viral gene pool analysis is also essential to obtain fundamental insight into ecosystem
  dynamics and to investigate how viruses influence the evolution of microbes and
  multicellular organisms. The Virus-X Consortium, established in 2016, included experts
  from eight European countries. The unique approach based on high throughput bioinformatics
  technologies combined with structural and functional studies resulted in the development
  of a biodiscovery pipeline of significant capacity and scale. The activities within
  the Virus-X consortium cover the entire range from bioprospecting and methods development
  in bioinformatics to protein production and characterisation, with the final goal
  of translating our results into new products for the bioeconomy. The significant
  impact the consortium made in all of these areas was possible due to the successful
  cooperation between expert teams that worked together to solve a complex scientific
  problem using state-of-the-art technologies as well as developing novel tools to
  explore the virosphere, widely considered as the last great frontier of life.
